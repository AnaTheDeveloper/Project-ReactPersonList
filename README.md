Notes:

Controlled vs Uncontrolled

Using state = controlled because their internal state is controlled by react.

Uncontrolled exmaple, using ref to reset dom to black because state isnt controlled by react. 

Google: In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.
